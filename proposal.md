# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Hey Purple

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive digital assistant that can recognize human voice and respond based on the user input.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will be programming this in Python using the built-in voice recognition library. The program will be called upon and it will take any user input (voice) and will respond accordingly.
The user inputs will be simple questions such as 'what time is it', 'how is the weather today', and even a simple command such as 'tell me a joke'. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will be able to properly set up the speech recognition and have the program successfully recognize our voice.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We think we can program it to give us the correct response to a question. For example, if we ask 'how is the weather today', it wouldn't respond with 'it's 10:00 am'.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope to be able to further apply what we learned about speech recognition to make it do other things such as convert speech to text using the microphone feature
or possibly create a word guessing game with the program.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We have to research what softwares and libraries we will need to have installed in order for this program to be possible. We have to watch some videos in regards to what each software
does and what the purpose of each library is and how it functions. The procedure will start off with importing the necessary libraries into our Python file. Next, we have to create an
instance that recognizes our voice. Then, we will create a function to capture the user's voice input using a microphone. Then, we will write some functions that will convert our voice
into text and process our voice commands. From there, we will just add/tweak some commands and potentially go beyond to create a game with the speech recognition feature.
