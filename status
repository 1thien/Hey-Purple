Hey Purple

***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Completed a function for Purple to recognize the user's voice and respond back to the user.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We haven't taught Purple how to respond to human commands. Purple is unable to perform tasks yet. After we figure that out, we are hoping to create a mini-interactive game with Purple.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We were having issues figuring out how to program a function that tells Purple how to answer simple questions or perform specific commands such as telling the user what time is it
and how the weather is today.
