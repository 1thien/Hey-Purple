One of the challenges we faced was understanding the voice recognition package. We wanted to make the bot repeat what we said but couldn't figure/understand that part which we would love to figure out in the future. I wouldn't say this was a challenge but learning how to use packages since it was our first time even finding out about this. We had issues with speech recognition not detecting our voice early in the project. We were stuck because we didn't know what the problem was but eventually found out that the problem was a combination of the installation and syntax errors. When it came to coming up with some features for the speech recognition, we just thought about the different projects that were given throughout the semesters and using that to create something. Integrating the speech recognition module into a Python script and seeing it work in real time was enjoyable to witness. Other than speech recognition, everything else went smoothly. We learned a lot about how far you can get with Python. We wanted to port this into some website/html but it was too advance since we had to learn HTML/CSS and use Flask. In the future, we would love to implement more into this project such as more commands where it could be very useful for daily life.
