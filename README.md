#  CIS 1051 Final Project - Hey Purple

### Modules required to run the program:
    https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/ 
    
    https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/
    
    https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/

### Copy and paste the following before running the program:
    pip install SpeechRecognition
    pip install pyttsx3
    pip install pywhatkit



### Demo: 





One of the challenges we faced was creating a project about a topic that we hadn't learned before. We had issues with speech recognition not detecting our voice early in the project. We were stuck because we didn't know what the problem was but eventually found out that the problem was a combination of the installation and syntax errors. When it came to coming up with some features for the speech recognition bot, we just thought about a few common commands people would have for a digital assistant such as Siri/Alexa and used those. Integrating the speech recognition module into a Python script and seeing it work in real time was enjoyable to witness. We learned a lot and are proud of what we accomplished with this project.
