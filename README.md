#  CIS 1051 Final Project - Hey Purple

### Modules required to run the program:
    https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/ 
    
    https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/
    
    https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/

### Copy and paste the following before running the program:
    pip install SpeechRecognition
    pip install pyttsx3
    pip install pywhatkit



### Demo: 





One of the challenges we faced was understanding the voice recongintion package. We wanted to make the bot repeat what we said but couldn't figure/understand that part which we would love to figure out in the future. I wouldn't say really this was a challenge but learning how to use packages since it was our first time even finding out about this. We had issues with speech recognition not detecting our voice early in the project. We were stuck because we didn't know what the problem was but eventually found out that the problem was a combination of the installation and syntax errors. When it came to coming up with some features for the speech recognition, we just thought about the different projects that were given throughout the semesters and using that to create something. Integrating the speech recognition module into a Python script and seeing it work in real time was enjoyable to witness, but basically when figureing out the speech recongintion everything else went smooth. We learned a lot about how far you can get with python. We wanted to port this into some website/html but it was too advance since we had to learn html/css and using Flask. In the future we would love to implent more into this project such as more commands where it could be very useful for daily life.
