## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. number guessing game: the computer generates a random number 1-100 and then the player has 3 attempts to guess that number. after every wrong guess, the computer tells you if your guess is above or below the correct number.
2. to do list: code a to do list that add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. the code also allows you to set deadlines and task priorities.
3. hey alexa: use python's built-in voice recognition library to serve as a digital assistant similar to alexa. the user can ask it some simple everyday questions such as what time is it and how is the weather today.
